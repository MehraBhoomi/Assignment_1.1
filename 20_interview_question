1] What are the primitive data types in most programming languages?
--> Integer, String, Boolean, Float, Complex are primitive datatypes.

2] Explain the difference between integers and floating-point numbers?
-->integers are whole numbers whereas floating point numbers are numbers with decimal values 

3] What is the purpose of a boolean data type, and how is it typically used?
-->Boolean data types can be used to store the values true and false in a database.

4] Describe the concept of type casting or type conversion.
-->type casting refers to conversion of one datatype to another datatype either by the coder or automatically by python.

5] What are the limitations of integer data types in terms of range and precision?
-->The INTEGER data type stores whole numbers that range from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647 for 9 or 10 digits of precision.
   The number 2,147,483,648 is a reserved value and cannot be used.

6] Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators with examples.
-->Unary : A unary operator is an operator, which operates on one operand.
   Binary : A binary operator is an operator, which operates on two operands.
   Ternary : A ternary operator is an operator, which operates on three operands.

7] Explain the difference between the '==' and '===' operators (or equivalent in your programming language).
--> = is a assignment operator 
    == is a comparision operator

8] How does the modulus (%) operator work, and what are its common use cases?
--> modulus operator % is used to find out the remainder of an integer or floating point numbers.

9] What is short-circuiting in logical operators, and why is it important?
--> Short circuiting means the second operator will not be checked if the first operator decides the final outcome.

10] Describe the difference between the postfix (x++) and prefix (++x) increment operators.
-->If you use the ++ operator as a prefix like: ++var , the value of var is incremented by 1;
   then it returns the value. If you use the ++ operator as a postfix like: var++ ,
   the original value of var is returned first; then var is incremented by 1.

11] What are conditional statements, and why are they important in programming?
--> conditional statements are written to instruct the computer give an output if and only if the stated condition is fulfilled.

12]Compare and contrast 'if', 'else if', and 'else' statements
-->if, elif, else are used to state conditional statements 
   if is compulsory statements to write a conditional statement
   elif and else are optional statements and one of them is executed when the condition above above does not fulfill.

13]Explain the purpose of a switch-case statement and provide an example.
-->The switch statement is used to test the equality of a variable against several values specified in the test cases.it is kind 
of  an if else elif ladder.

14] What is the ternary conditional operator, and how is it used?
-->The Python ternary operator (or conditional operator), tests if a condition is true or false and, depending on the outcome, 
   returns the corresponding value â€” all in just one line of code.

15] What is a function, and why is it important in programming?
--> function keyword is used to define a whole custom function and this function can be used later in the code.

16]Explain the difference between function parameters and arguments.
-->The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. 
   The variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as parameters.

17] What is the return statement, and how does it work in functions?
-->A return statement ends the execution of a function

18] Discuss the concept of function overloading or polymorphism (if applicable in your programming language).
-->the concept of overloading or ploymorphism is about the usage of particular operator or an entity changes with respect to an object

19] How do you declare and define a recursive function, and what are the potential pitfalls to watch out for?
-->A Recursive function can be defined as a routine that calls itself directly or indirectly which leads to a lot of memory utilisation.

20] What is the purpose of a 'for' loop, and how does it differ from a 'while' loop?
-->For loop is used when the number of iterations is already known.
    While loop is used when the number of iterations is already Unknown
